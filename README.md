To ensure my code is both functional and secure, I focused on implementing thorough testing strategies and adopting security best practices from the start. Unit tests, like those in the in each of the milestones, help validate that each component works as expected. Keeping the ID of each service unique and uneditable, it keeps the security of that variable. I also prioritized input validation and error handling to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. By automating tests with JUnit, I’m able to quickly identify errors, maintain a consistent testing routine, and ensure my code remains secure as it evolves.

Interpreting user needs requires an ongoing dialogue between the software requirements and the end user's expectations. I start by breaking down the requirements into clear, actionable tasks, then designing the software with flexibility in mind to accommodate changes or new needs that arise. In these projects, I incorporated user needs by continuously reviewing the scope of the program, adjusting features to meet functional demands, and ensuring the design was intuitive and scalable. My approach to designing software is iterative—beginning with a solid foundation, then refining the design through feedback, testing, and incremental improvements to create a reliable, user-friendly solution.
